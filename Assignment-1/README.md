# About

This is the first assignment for Real-Time Rendering (CS7GV3) at Trinity College Dublin. For this assignment, I have implemented 6 different Reflectance Models, i.e., Phong, Blinn Phong, Toon, Gooch, Minnaert, and the Cook-Torrance.

# Demonstration

The video demonstration for the assignment can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2mE3FI-L6w)
