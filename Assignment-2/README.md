# Assignment - 2

## TODO
- [ ] Implement a Shader for an object that is both transmissive and reflective
 - [ ] Transmission may entail any of the effects discussed in the last lecture but most likely refraction
 - [ ] Include a Fresnel component in your shader
 - [ ] Include the chromatic dispersion effect 
 - [x] Environment texture, cube map or sphere map in your scene which affects the appearance of your object

- [ ] Implement a scene with some rotating objects using the above shaders
  - [ ] Make the scene as photorealistic as possible
  - [ ] Add some variation in models, scene, shader to make your demo slightly unique
